"""Library for creating sequence-to-sequence models in TensorFlow.
Sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks can learn complex functions
that map input sequences to output sequences. These models yield very good
results on a number of tasks, such as speech recognition, parsing, machine
translation, or even constructing automated replies to emails.
Before using this module, it is recommended to read the TensorFlow tutorial
on sequence-to-sequence models. It explains the basic concepts of this module
and shows an end-to-end example of how to build a translation model.
  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html
Here is an overview of functions available in this module. They all use
a very similar interface, so after reading the above tutorial and using
one of them, others should be easy to substitute.
* Full sequence-to-sequence models.
  - basic_rnn_seq2seq: The most basic RNN-RNN model.
  - tied_rnn_seq2seq: The basic model with tied encoder and decoder weights.
  - embedding_rnn_seq2seq: The basic model with input embedding.
  - embedding_tied_rnn_seq2seq: The tied model with input embedding.
  - embedding_attention_seq2seq: Advanced model with input embedding and
      the neural attention mechanism; recommended for complex tasks.
* Multi-task sequence-to-sequence models.
  - one2many_rnn_seq2seq: The embedding model with multiple decoders.
* Decoders (when you write your own encoder, you can use these to decode;
    e.g., if you want to write a model that generates captions for images).
  - rnn_decoder: The basic decoder based on a pure RNN.
  - attention_decoder: A decoder that uses the attention mechanism.
* Losses.
  - sequence_loss: Loss for a sequence model returning average log-perplexity.
  - sequence_loss_by_example: As above, but not averaging over all examples.
* model_with_buckets: A convenience function to create models with bucketing
    (see the tutorial above for an explanation of why and how to use it).

  """Create a sequence-to-sequence model with support for bucketing.
  The seq2seq argument is a function that defines a sequence-to-sequence model,
  e.g., seq2seq = lambda x, y: basic_rnn_seq2seq(
      x, y, core_rnn_cell.GRUCell(24))
  Args:
    asr_encoder_inputs: A list of Tensors to feed the encoder; first seq2seq input.
    encoder_inputs: A list of Tensors to feed the encoder; first seq2seq input.
    decoder_inputs: A list of Tensors to feed the decoder; third seq2seq input.
    targets: A list of 1D batch-sized int32 Tensors (desired output sequence).
    weights: List of 1D batch-sized float-Tensors to weight the targets.
    buckets: A list of pairs of (input size, output size) for each bucket.
    seq2seq: A sequence-to-sequence model function; it takes 2 input that
      agree with encoder_inputs and decoder_inputs, and returns a pair
      consisting of outputs and states (as, e.g., basic_rnn_seq2seq).
    softmax_loss_function: Function (labels, logits) -> loss-batch
      to be used instead of the standard softmax (the default if this is None).
      **Note that to avoid confusion, it is required for the function to accept
      named arguments.**
    per_example_loss: Boolean. If set, the returned loss will be a batch-sized
      tensor of losses for each sequence in the batch. If unset, it will be
      a scalar with the averaged loss from all examples.
    name: Optional name for this operation, defaults to "model_with_buckets".
  Returns:
    A tuple of the form (outputs, losses), where:
      outputs: The outputs for each bucket. Its j'th element consists of a list
        of 2D Tensors. The shape of output tensors can be either
        [batch_size x output_size] or [batch_size x num_decoder_symbols]
        depending on the seq2seq model used.
      losses: List of scalar Tensors, representing losses for each bucket, or,
        if per_example_loss is set, a list of 1D batch-sized float Tensors.
  Raises:
    ValueError: If length of encoder_inputs, targets, or weights is smaller
      than the largest (last) bucket.
